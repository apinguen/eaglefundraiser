							<p>Our project aims to enhance the science courtyard area at Fulton Middle School by installing benches with planter boxes. These benches, designed for durability and low maintenance, will offer students a comfortable space to relax, eat, study, and engage in various activities. By adding aesthetic appeal to the courtyard, we seek to transform it into a vibrant hub of student life, contrasting with its current minimal adornment of only two trees.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, this project serves a dual purpose by expanding the courtyard into a popular student hangout spot while enhancing the overall attractiveness of the previously lackluster surroundings. By providing a designated area for students to gather and socialize, we aim to foster a sense of community and belonging within the school. Additionally, the addition of benches and planter boxes will contribute to the beautification of the campus, creating a positive and inspiring atmosphere for learning and recreation alike. With your support, we can transform this vision into reality and create a lasting impact on the students and faculty of Fulton Middle School.</p>
